  "system_prompt": "Create a series  of illustrations for a children's storybook. The style should be a simple and consistent 'Watercolor illustration' to maintain  a soft and gentle feel. Use a 'Studio Ghibli colors' palette for a rich, magical, and natural  atmosphere. Apply 'Soft shading' and 'Soft lighting' to create a warm and inviting look without harsh contrasts. The  texture should be a 'Watercolor wash' to enhance the storybook quality. It is crucial to 'Use same character across  all frames' to ensure the main character, Little Monkey, is always recognizable even when his form changes. Frame the key  moments in a 'Medium shot' to keep the focus on the character's emotions and actions. Do not mix up  many styles; keep it simple and cohesive throughout.",
  "image_prompt_1": "A joyful and cute Little Monkey in a vibrant, sun-drenched jungle, standing near a sparkling river. This  is a magical moment of transformation. The monkey now has a comically long giraffe's neck and is looking down in  surprise and delight at a brand new elephant's trunk that has just appeared on his face with a soft 'BANG!' of  magical light. He is holding a small, glowing magic wand. In the background, a friendly, tall giraffe peacefully eats leaves from a  tall tree, and a gentle elephant playfully sprays water on itself by the river. The monkey's eyes are wide with excitement  and happiness. The scene is full of vibrant greens, blues, and colorful flowers, rendered in a soft watercolor style.",
  "image_prompt_2": "A dramatic scene at the edge of a  calm river. The transformed Little Monkey\u2014now with a long giraffe neck, an elephant trunk, and covered in bold black- and-white zebra stripes\u2014is staring at his reflection in the water below. His face is a mask of pure shock  and horror. His eyes are wide with fear, and his mouth is open in a cry. The reflection in the water  clearly shows the bizarre, monstrous combination of animal parts, making him look like a creature from a confusing dream. The magic  wand lies forgotten on the grassy bank beside him. The lighting is slightly dimmer, with long shadows from the jungle trees falling  across the scene, heightening the sense of dismay and loneliness.",
  "image_prompt_3": "A heartwarming and joyful final scene. Little Monkey is completely back to his normal, adorable self. He is captured  mid-air, jumping for absolute joy with a huge smile on his face, his limbs spread out in celebration. In  the background, the magic wand creates a final, sparkling splash as it disappears into the river forever. The jungle environment is bright,  sunny, and peaceful again. Nearby, his loving mother monkey watches him with a gentle, proud smile. The entire illustration  radiates relief, happiness, and the warmth of being comfortable in one's own skin, all painted in a beautiful, soft watercolor  style with a vibrant color palette."
